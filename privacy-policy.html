        <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
            Hello, we are TURTLE Software Inc. (“TURTLE” or “We”)!
            Respect for your privacy is important to you and to us. It’s essential that we earn your trust, and that TURTLE’
            practices reflect our respect for your privacy. In this spirit, we created this policy to help you comprehend how we
            collect, use, disclose or otherwise process your personal data. We also cover information about your rights and other
            important details about your privacy, like how we secure your personal data. If you have any questions, please feel free
            to email our privacy support officer at turtlellc@yahoo.com. Where relevant, TURTLE is the Controller under this policy.
            When does this policy apply?
            This privacy policy applies to all our mobile apps (our ‘Apps’) and to your use of our websites (‘Websites’ or ‘Web’):
            <br>
            <br>
            <a href="https://turtlellc.github.io/">https://turtlellc.github.io/</a>
            <br>
            <br>
            This policy also applies to communications you may have with us via email, through live chat on our Apps or through
            social media.
            When you click on links to third parties’ websites, or if you use a third party to create accounts on our Apps or
            websites, such as Google, Facebook or Twitter, this privacy policy does not apply to your sharing of personal data with
            these third parties. It’s always a good idea to read their privacy policies to understand what they do with your
            personal data.
            <br><br>
            Our Apps and Websites can be accessed and used from around the world. The laws that apply to the protection of your
            personal data may vary depending on where you reside. TURTLE strives to comply with all applicable laws – if you have
            questions based on your situation, feel free to contact privacy support at <a href="turtlellc@yahoo.com">turtlellc@yahoo.com</a>. To see the specific
            Privacy notice applicable to Texas residents.
            <h4>When will I know that this policy has changed?</h4>
            We reserve the right to and may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. Please review this policy regularly for
            the latest updates on our data privacy practices. If we make any material changes, we will notify you through the App,
            or by presenting you with a new version of this Privacy Policy. Your continued use of the App after the effective date
            of an updated version of the Privacy Policy will indicate your acceptance of the Privacy Policy as modified. In some
            cases, we will need to request that you accept changes to the Privacy Policy explicitly. In these cases where explicit
            acceptance is required, we will contact you to request your acceptance. If you do not accept the terms of the Privacy
            Policy, you may not use the App or Websites. Please exit the App and Websites immediately if you do not agree to the
            terms of this Privacy Policy.
            <h4>What do we mean by ‘personal data’?</h4>
            We want to protect your privacy as much as possible, so we consider personal data to include any information which
            allows us to identify you directly or indirectly, including through cookies and other electronic tools.
            What do we mean by ‘cookies’?
            <br><br>
            Like many websites, our Websites and Apps use “cookies” to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that a
            website puts on your computer’s hard disk so that the website can remember something about you at a later time. If you
            are looking for more information on cookies, you can refer to websites such as <a href="http://www.cookiecentral.com/">http://www.cookiecentral.com/</a>.
            In this privacy policy, when we refer to “cookies” we include other technologies with similar purposes, such as pixels,
            tags, web beacons and the mobile identifiers which we collect from your cell phone (Android’s Advertising ID (AAID/IFA)
            or Apple’s Identifier for Advertising).
            <br><br>
            There are different types of cookies. TURTLE uses both first party and third party cookies:
            <br><br>
            • First Party Cookies – First party cookies are those that are issued by us, and they can only be set or retrieved by
            us. They are used for purposes specific to us, such as to personalize the Website.
            <br>
            • Third Party Cookies – Third party cookies are placed on our Websites, in emails or Apps by other entities, such as to
            create new functionalities, to monitor the activity of users on a Website/App for the purpose of Web/App analytics or
            conduct advertising.
            <br><br>
            Cookies can also be classified based on their roles. These are the types of cookies we use on our Websites and Apps:
            <br><br>
            • Strictly Necessary – These cookies are essential to enable you to navigate our website and use its key features.
            <br>
            • Performance Cookies – Performance cookies collect information about how users use our websites or Apps, such as the
            pages they go to most often, what pages or functions they use, how long a user spends meditating, and whether they get
            error messages from our webpages. These cookies provide us with information about our sites/apps traffic and
            performance. The actions and activities may be attributable to your device information, browsers, email address and/or
            IP address.
            <br>
            • Functionality Cookies – These cookies are used for enhanced functionalities that are useful to you, such as social
            media sharing, but which are not necessary for our websites or Apps to perform their essential functions.
            <br>
            • Targeting Cookies – These cookies are used to deliver advertising more relevant to you and your interests. They are
            also used to limit the number of times you see an ad as well as to help measure the effectiveness of a campaign.
            If you are using one of our Websites, you can change your browser’s settings so it will stop accepting cookies and web
            beacons or to prompt you before accepting a cookie or web beacon. Opt-out options for cookies and web beacons.

            <h4>Personal Data you provide us directly</h4>
            General Information. When you sign up to use the App, we may collect Personal Data about you such as:

            • Email address you assign to your account; and <br>
            • Password or passcode you assigned to your account. <br><br>
            You can create an account on some of our Apps and Websites using your Facebook, Google, Apple or Twitter account (you
            should read the applicable third party privacy policy to see what other information those parties collect when you use
            their account to login to our Websites/Apps).
            <br><br>
            Sleep and Well-being. When you use the App, you may choose to provide personal information which might be considered
            related to your health and well-being such as:
            <br>
            • When you wake up and when you go to sleep (and other things related to your sleep patterns);<br>
            • When you feel hungry; and <br>
            • If you meditate and for how long. <br><br>
            You also may give us the ability to import into the App Personal Data about your health and activities from third-party
            services such as Apple HealthKit and Google Fit. Such imported Personal Data may include your sleep patterns/data. In
            order for us to process any Personal Data under this category we will explicitly ask your consent on the registration
            screen. <br><br>
            If you take our sleep “chronotypes” quiz, we will only temporarily collect your answers to those questions for the
            purposes of delivering your “sleep score” or chronotype number. We do not store your individual answers to the
            chronotypes quiz, but we may store your “sleep score” against your unique TURTLE client ID and you will be able to see
            your chronotype in your profile. <br><br>
            <h4>Personal Data we may collect automatically</h4>
            When you access or use the App or Web, we may automatically collect the following information: <br>

            We do not collect precise location data about you, although we are able to see in which city you are located, based on
            your IP address. We also collect information about the browser or device used to access the Website and App, such as the
            user’s mobile device ID (if you consent/opt in to tracking this) and IP address. This allows us to personalize your
            experience, and ensure that you are receiving relevant content and the right legal disclosures applicable to you based

            customize and personalize your App experience. We may also use such data for statistical purposes and analytics.
            <h4>How do we use your Personal Data?</h4>

            performance of the App/site. We only rely on our or a third party’s legitimate interests when these interests are not
            overridden by your rights and interests. <br>
            • Legal obligation. We may be obligated to process some of your Personal Data to comply with applicable laws and
            regulations. <br><br>

            <h4>Use of Cookies, Web Beacons, and Similar Technology for Advertising Networks</h4>
            You and others may see certain ads for our Apps or Websites on other websites because we participate in ad networks. Ad
            networks allow us to target our messaging to users through demographic, interest-based, and contextual means. These
            networks track individuals’ online activities over time by collecting information through automated means, including
            through the use of cookies, web server logs, and web beacons. The networks use this information to show advertisements
            that may be tailored to an individual’s interests. The information our ad networks may collect includes information
            about your visits to websites that participate in the relevant ad networks, such as the pages or advertisements you view
            and the actions you take on the websites. This data collection takes place both on our websites and on third-party
            websites that participate in the ad networks. This process also helps us track the effectiveness of our marketing
            efforts and assists other websites and advertising partners to find you or people like you on different platforms,
            including social media websites. <br> <br>
            By way of example, if you use Web (only) we may use Facebook Conversion Tracking Pixel to record how efficient our
            advertisements are for statistical and market research purposes. Facebook may connect the data with your Facebook
            account and use the data for their own advertising purposes, in accordance with its current privacy policy, No direct
            Facebook tracking is enabled in the App. <br> <br>
            Google Analytics offers a function about remarketing audiences. It allows us to create segments based on the analytics
            that we have obtained, and then use it as part of remarketing campaigns on our Google Ads account. Google Ads uses a
            different cookie than Google Analytics.s mentioned above, you can opt-out of cookies and web beacons.
            <h4>Analytics and Performance Partners</h4>
            In addition to using AppsFlyer for analytics, we also use Iterable, Facebook SDK and Mixpanel to measure our performance
            and to help increase the performance of our ad campaigns. These third parties provide us with analytics for our Websites
            and Apps, which can then be used to segment users based on demographic information, custom events and user or session
            activity as part of our interest-based advertising activities. We also use analytics to learn about how we can improve
            our site and App and offer more services and functionality that may interest you.
            We also use Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting to better understand our websites’ performance. Google
            Analytics uses third party cookies to get information about how you arrived on our website, the search terms which were
            leveraged, the time of your visit, etc. <br><br>

            • Emailing us at <a href="turtlellc@yahoo.com">turtlellc@yahoo.com</a> <br>
            Only you, or someone legally authorized to act on your behalf, may make a request to know or delete related to your
            personal information. <br> <br>
            You may only submit a request to know twice within a 12-month period. Your request to know or delete must:
            • Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal
            information or an authorized representative, which may include: <br>
            • Logging in to your Web/App account using your username and password; <br>
            • Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it. <br> <br>
            We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or
            authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you.
            You will not need to have an existing account with us to submit a request to know or delete. However, we do consider
            requests made through your password protected account sufficiently verified when the request relates to personal
            information associated with that specific account.
            We will only use personal information provided in the request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make
            it.

            <h4>Response Timing and Format</h4>
            We will confirm receipt of your request within ten (10) business days. If you do not receive confirmation within the
            10-day timeframe, please contact <a href="turtlellc@yahoo.com">turtlellc@yahoo.com</a>.
            We endeavor to substantively respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt. If we
            require more time (up to another 45 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.
            If you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to that account. If you do not have an account with
            us, we will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option.
            Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding our receipt of your request. The response we
            provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we
            will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the
            information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.br <br>
            We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or
            manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and
            provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.
            Non-Discrimination <br>
            We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights. Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not: <br> <br>
            • Deny you goods or services. <br>
            • Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or
            imposing penalties. <br>
            • Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services. <br>
            • Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods
            or services. <br>

            request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing
            purposes. To make such a request, please send an email toturtlellc@yahoo.com.

            While our website and services are not intended for anyone under the age of 18, if you are a Texas resident who is under
            age 18 and you are unable to remove publicly-available content that you have submitted to us, you may request removal by
            contacting us at: turtlellc@yahoo.com. When requesting removal, you must be specific about the information you want
            removed and provide us with specific information, such as the URL for each page where the information was entered, so
            that we can find it. <br>
            We are not required to remove any content or information that: (1) federal or state law requires us or a third party to
            maintain; (2) was not posted by you; (3) is anonymized so that you cannot be identified; (4) you don’t follow our
            instructions for removing or requesting removal; or (5) you received compensation or other consideration for providing
            the content or information. Removal of your content or information from our system does not ensure complete or
            comprehensive removal of that content or information from our systems or the systems of our service providers. We are
            not required to delete the content or information posted by you; our obligations under Texas law are satisfied so long
            as we anonymize the content or information or render it invisible to other users and the public.
